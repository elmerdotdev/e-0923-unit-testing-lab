// Objective: Create a function that capitalizes the first letter of a string.

// Task: In capitalizeString.js, define a function capitalizeString that accepts a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

// Testing: In capitalizeString.test.js, include tests for a lowercase word (e.g., "test" should return "Test"), a word that's already capitalized, and a string that's all uppercase (which should only change the first letter to uppercase and the rest to lowercase).
